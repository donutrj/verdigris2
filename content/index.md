# Intent
I've written a lot of games before this with similar d6 pool mechanics. I've made games with fun battles and team play. What I want to build here is a campaign friendly system with a lot of room for character development. Much of what former games lacked was progression, I hope this gives players the kind of enjoyable choice-paralysis that drives my group. 
# Setting
The collapse of the empire nearly 150 years ago continues to have consequences today. When their Pantheon turned on itself, many eldest gods were lost, their servants dead. As cities burned, so did their libraries and teachings. Young gods rose up, once considered heretical, they established a sense of legitimacy. 

Now in these latter years the survivors have scattered. Where once Caledonia held a near monopoly on power, the teaching of magic and machinery have spread far. Young colleges have sprung up, new guilds have been established. Trade secrets have been spilled while others have simply found a new home.

Lessons have been learned. Where once thick blocks of infantry ruled the field, now the heavy horse is seen as the peak. Even that is challenged though, now with blackpowder being increasingly accessible, both foot and horse have adopted the damnable technology, expensive as it is.

The state system for developing powerful battlemages has been lost to time. Such an intense process necessarily created substantial human detritus. The focuses of modern education are less intensive and intrusive–resulting in less waste. Caledonia's universities, while gutted, still exist. Many still study there, as professors try to reclaim lost knowledge. 

The land is littered with petty kings. Leveraging a mix of mercenary troops and local armies, they war. Some ape the past, seeking to reclaim and rebuild the glory of old while others reject it, looking to the future.
# Mechanics
Verdigris is a classless system built on the Mutant: Year Zero Engine. Players make [[Components of a Character#Attributes|tests]] and [[Components of a Character#Saves|saves]] to overcome challenges and avoid harm. Players roll pools of d6s, aiming to collect sixes, while weighing the risk of pushing the roll.

Learn more about the [[Components of a Character|player characters]] or build one here.

Verdigris is also heavily inspired by other games; originally called Symhammer - as a amalgam of Symbaroum and Warhammer Fantasy. Inspiration is also taken from Knave, WutC, and many, many blog posts.
