title: Verdigris

# Intent
I've written a lot of games before this with similar d6 pool mechanics. I've made games with fun battles and team play. What I want to build here is a campaign friendly system with a lot of room for character development. Much of what former games lacked was progression, I hope this gives players the kind of enjoyable choice-paralysis that drives my group. 
# Mechanics
Verdigris is a classless system built on the Mutant: Year Zero Engine. Players make [[Tests & Saves#Tests|tests]] and [[Tests & Saves#Saves|saves]] to overcome challenges and avoid harm. Players roll pools of d6s, aiming to collect sixes, while weighing the risk of pushing the roll.

Verdigris is also heavily inspired by other games; originally called Symhammer - as a amalgam of Symbaroum and Warhammer Fantasy. Inspiration is also taken from Knave, WutC, and many, many blog posts.
# Getting Started
Verdigris is intended to run in a late medieval fantasy setting, you're welcome to read more about it [[Setting|here]]. Alternatively as a player feel free to get started by [[Characters|generating a character]].
