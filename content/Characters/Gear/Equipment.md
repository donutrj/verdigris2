# Inventory
A character’s inventory is split between three spaces: hands, belt, and pack. Each space uses slots to roughly denote the amount they can hold. One slot can hold roughly a dozen eggs, but is more an idea than a hard rule.

| Items   | Size                                                                                                                              |

| Books   | Books take up a slot each                                                                                                         |
| Clothes | A day's clothes equals one slot, more elaborate attire will require more space                                                    |
| Coinage | Coins can be grouped into sacks of 100 per slot. Loose change and other coin sized objects can be grouped together into one slot. |
| Potions | One slot                                                                                                                          |

| Shields | Cannot be stored on belt, one slot                                                                                                |
| Weapons | Two-handed weapons take up two slots, otherwise one slot                                                                          |
## Hands
Hands are what characters actively hold. There are two slots, each for one hand. If weapons are held here, they are considered drawn, and people will be hostile.
## Belt
A character’s belt is where you’d stash your weapon, ammo, and other rapidly accessible items.
## Pack
A character’s pack is where they keep bulk items that don’t need to be accessed in the heat of the moment. A pack is equal to character's [[Characters#Attributes|strength]]. 
# Selling Goods
When selling goods to merchants, players typically receive half the listed value. At GM discretion,  players may make a single Charisma Test to haggle. If successful, the merchant will pay an additional ten percent per SL.
## Coinage
Merchants operate on the silver system, where most currency is in silver. Most merchants will also happily accept gold, at an exchange rate of 60 silver to a gold.
# Animals
Animals require care, but under most circumstances are self-sufficient. In harsh climates, characters might need to supply food or water.
