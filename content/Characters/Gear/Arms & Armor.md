## Non-Inherent Qualities
### Engraved
Engraving  is the quickest way to elevate yourself above other wealthy folk. The weapon has had art etched into it, as per the buyer’s instruction. It has no mechanical benefit, merely social and monetary. 
+ The cost of engraving is applied after other qualities.
+ Standard non-custom engraving costs 300 marks 
+ Simple custom engraving costs 500 marks
+ Truly exceptional engravings can be had for 1000 marks
### Guildmade
Marked with the seals of the craftsman guilds, you know this piece is of high quality. Organized labor costs extra, and the guilds can always refuse to sell to unscrupulous buyers.
+ Increase the weapon’s bonus by 1 - it costs (base + 10) * 1.5
### Masterwork
A masterwork piece is the best a craftsman can offer. A one of a kind tool. It is balanced, smooth, and terribly effective. 
+ Increase the weapon’s bonus by 2 - it costs (base + 70) * 3
### Shoddy
This weapon was made quickly and as cheaply as possible. It will likely serve, for now. 
+ Decrease the weapon’s bonus by 1. If the bonus is already 1, reduce the damage by 1 instead. 
+ Reduce the cost of the weapon by 25%.
## Ammo

| Shot & Ball   | 12    | 8    |            |
## A Note on Blackpowder
Blackpowder weapons are complicated & fickle. They rely on a delicate trigger mechanism which is hand-fit to each weapon.

All but the very newest weapons are matchlocks, requiring a smoldering matchcord to be ready at all times. If the cord isn't lit before combat, the user must spend an action readying the match before it can be fired.

Even with all the faults, the effects of powder cannot be denied. Blackpowder weapons ignore armor.
