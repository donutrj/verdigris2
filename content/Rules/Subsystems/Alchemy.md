Potions have long been a powerful force in the life of adventurers. From the ability to smell lies or climb walls as a spider, to the simple classics like a fireball or healing tonic-potions have a long and varied past.

To brew potions you must have the Alchemy talent and be properly equipped. A brewer must have a stone cauldron (granite or basalt) and the correct ingredients for their potion of choice. A cauldron does not need to be big, but the metals of common cookware typically react with the brewing process. 

Once equipped, a potion takes four hours over the fire to produce, aka 1 shift (in downtime terms). 

While the potions produced by large organizations can last nigh indefinitely in some cases, the typical home brewer can only keep a few in proper alchemical balance at any given time. 

You can maintain a number of potions equal to your intelligence.
## Ingredient Guidelines

Potions reflect the ingredients that go into them. Rare and powerful sources of energy will produce greater effects. Use the below guide to understand common examples and limitations. 

| Rarity      | Typical Effects                                                                                                                          | Typical Ingredients                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commonplace | 1d6 wounds recovered, 1 condition recovery, reduce stress by 1d6, minor persistent effects for 30 minutes, major effects for 1–5 minutes | Tree sap, eggshell, dog's brain, eye of newt, spider silk, honeycomb, sand |
| Uncommon    | 2d6 wounds, 1–2 conditions, stress to 0, minor effects 1 day, major effects, 30 minutes                                                  | human fingers, target's hair, gold & gems, blood of intelligent creatures  |
| Rare        | 5d6 wounds, all conditions, stress to 0, minor effects 1 week, major effects 1 day                                                       | Ground unicorn horn, angel hair, ancient relics, dragon's heart            |

These are just guidelines and should only be treated as such. If something is easy to get then it likely isn't going to be a powerful effect. 

For example, if someone is missing a limb, just because "target's hair" is on the list of uncommon ingredients that doesn't mean it'll be powerful potion if you pluck one of their hairs. 

Perhaps if they are missing a leg, the alchemist might need another human leg and some hair from the player character to help regrow the limb. Of course you'd probably need a third ingredient; something associated with regrowth.
