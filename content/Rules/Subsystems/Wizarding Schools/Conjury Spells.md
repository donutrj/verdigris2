## Barnlight
Target: 2SL

Barnlight has long been used as a way to provide long-term lighting to areas especially prone to fires. It is a particularly flexible spell where overcasting can be channeled into more light rather than resulting in miscasts.

An area is permanently lit by a gentle light. Overcasting results in a brighter light. Note that barnlights grow colder the more overcast the spell. 

4+ SL results in a bright light. 8+ SL results in a blinding light. 
## Cloudkill
Target: 2SL

The caster exhales a heavier-than-air cloud large enough to fill a small room. It smells of whatever the caster last ate.

Those caught in the cloud cannot breathe and are considered drowning. Should one breathe the cloud they take 2x spell SL wounds minus the SL of an endurance test. The cloud lingers for 20 minutes after which it will dissipate. 
## Color Spray
Target: 1SL

Alien colors burst from the caster’s eyes, spraying those around them.

The target, either an individual or all those within a melee, are considered stunned for SL turns. 

Stunned creatures can either more or take an action, not both. They also cannot take any reactions. 
## Dimension Door
Target: 2SL

The caster uses a traditionally sappy chalk, to draw a portal moving through it to another point within line of sight. Attempting to draw the portal on grass or similarly uneven surfaces results in an automatic -1 SL.

The caster can teleport to another point within line of sight by going through the drawn portal. The portal collapses after SL beings have passed through. If drawn around the feet of the caster (or other creature) they fall through and are knocked prone as they reach the other side.
## Fogbank
Target: 2SL

Used by many battlemages to obscure troop movements and many hedge-witches to shelter crops from the heat of summer. Can be cleared by strong wind. 

Over the course of several minutes a dense fog spreads from the caster, eventually reaching the size of a large field, obscuring the area. The fog lasts 30 minutes in direct sunlight but can last consecutive days in naturally foggy environments. 
## Gust
Target: 1SL

As magic is channeled through the sweeping arms of the caster, it transforms into a strong wind capable of knocking things aside. A common spell for a ship's mage. 

A target must make a dodge test meeting the spell’s SL to avoid being knocked prone. Can be used to extinguish torches or other lights. Not typically lethal, but should the target be patrolling  a wall or near the edge of a ship, their life might be in peril. 
## Horsbraile’s Needle of Thaum
Target: 3SL

Cast in reaction to another spell going off, doing so is a reaction and will forfeit your next turn in combat

Summons a silver-blue needle that shoots towards the opposing caster’s work, piercing it and releasing a number of white pigeons equal to the SL of the two spells combined.
## Rainfall
Target: 3SL

A clearly useful spell. Heavily utilized for both warfare and agriculture, rainfall can produce light drizzling over large areas or intense downpours in localized areas. If the land is naturally raining, the spell amplifies the effect, resulting in a debilitating torrent.

An area within the caster’s line of sight suffers rain. Concentrated in a compact area, such as a farmer’s field or the space around a building results in a heavy downpour, obscuring vision and creating noise. If already storming, the spell can amplify the rain to a degree causing minor wounds, dealing 1 wound to those caught in it for every 5 minutes.

The spell sustains for 5*SL minutes.
