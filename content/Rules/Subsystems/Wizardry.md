Long refined spells are passed from master to student, copied in colleges and libraries, and slowly iterated upon by generations. As time passes, wars consume kingdoms, and fads pass; much of what is learned is lost to time. Branches form, and people start new schools of magic. 

Famous wizards retain credit for their spells, while the bold young add their own names to tomorrow's spells.
# Casting
Once a character has taken the [[Talents Master List#Wizardry|wizardry]] or [[Talents Master List#Witch|witch]] talent, they use their channel and cast skills to recite their spells from tomes. 

Each spell has a target value or range, denoting the SL required to successfully cast the spell. Casting is much like a normal test, where if you meet the SL, the spell is cast as described.

Channel allows magic to accumulate over multiple rounds of combat, where you make a Channel test and add the SL to previous rolls, slowly building to more powerful spells. This requires unbroken concentration.

When a caster feels they have gathered enough power via Channel, they make a Cast Test, and if it has at least 1 SL, they add the sum of their Channel tests to the Cast SL and resolve the spell. 

Breaking a caster’s concentration (typically when struck with a weapon) while Channeling results in an immediate roll on the Magical Catastrophe table.
## Resolving Spells
Spells are fickle little shits. Unless your SL falls within the range of the spell, roll on the magical mishap table. If the Cast Test SL is greater than the spell’s target, it still activates, you just need to also roll on the magical mishap table. 

Landing either side of the spell’s target on a pushed roll results in a magical catastrophe rather than a magical mishap. Push carefully.
# Mana Drain
Every time a wizard casts a spell, they suffer one drain. This is a cumulative penalty to all future channeling and casting tests until the wizard spends a full night resting. 

This penalty builds with each cast, not channel, tests. Although once present, it affects both tests. 

Drain does not affect saves.
# Schools of Magic
Magic is divided into ‘schools’. This is not necessarily the result of base differences in magic but the product of different focuses of study resulting in different paths of understanding.
## Conjury
Conjury, also known as summoning, is a school of magic primarily used in agriculture. However no one pretends that it isn't used in all forms of circumstances. Weather and animals are two great areas of research.

## Elementalism
The goal of elementalism is to derive the most base elements of existence. Then use them to alter the world around them. This is the magic of fireballs and ice-rays. It is the study chosen by those who desire the power for the flashiest of spells and those who seek the deepest understanding of the universe’s building blocks.

## Enchantment
Once two separate schools, enchantment & transmutation. Enchantment is the art of granting properties to things that it would not otherwise have. This includes simple properties, ongoing effects, and altering of a thing’s base self.

## Scrying
Scrying is the art of knowing. Used to gain info from people, animals, the dead and others; it is a magic of communication. Primarily employed in politics and trade, it is largely frowned upon as a school of dark tricks. Regardless, it remains widely studied.

| 21     | **Scream**: Caster freezes in place, stares straight up, and screams at the top of their lungs. This behavior continues, without so much as a pause for breath, for the next 24 hours. The volume steadily increases this entire time; it is audible for miles around; people standing too close will be deafened. |

Affects remain until healed to full wounds.                                                                                                                                  |
| 23     | **Doppelganger**: Your skin detaches messily – dealing half your max wounds as it sloughs off – then animates as an undead entity intent on the party’s death.                                                                                                                                                     |

Hot surfaces cause +1 stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3      | **Inverted**: The spell has the exact opposite effect as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4      | **Forefathers**: Caster receives one year of someone else's memories from the distant past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5      | **Truesight**: You gain the ability to see all the things that normal people subconsciously edit out of their perceptions to maintain their sense of reality. You have a minimum of 1 stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6      | **Ragdoll**: You are flung 2d6 yards in a random direction with great force. Take 1d6 wounds in addition to environmental hazards. Characters within range make a dodge test to avoid being knocked prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7      | **Inscribed**: Caster is now covered in tattooed script; an ancient and forgotten spell. It can be cast (once) by reading the caster's skin like a scroll, burning it from their flesh in the casting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8      | **Horsefly**: Caster loses sense of taste. This is temporary, and will return with terrible intensity in d6 weeks. (+2 bonus to relevant tests). Unpleasant tastes cause +1 stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9      | **Criminal**: Random items tend to appear in caster's belongings; eventually it will become clear that these items all link the caster to a variety of high-profile and especially heinous crimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10     | **Twisted**: Forget the spell you attempted to cast and instead successfully cast & learn a random spell from the forbidden lore section at the same target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11     | **Omens**: Caster is plagued by constant ominous events: any journey they set out on starts on a gloomy, rainy day; the mournful croaking of ravens comes from virtually every tree they pass; livestock give birth to two-headed young whenever caster is in town; blood-red comets regularly seen in sky; etc. This continues until a terrible act of fate befalls a nearby politically important figure.                                                                                                        |
| 12     | **Bystander**: Reroll another catastrophe, with the caster’s role in the result replaced by another player’s character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13     | **Shuffle**: You, and all those in the same area swap places randomly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 14     | **Bloodhound**: Caster loses sense of smell. This is temporary, and will return with great force in d6 weeks. (+2 bonus to relevant tests) Unpleasant smells cause +1 stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15     | **Cubed**: The magical backlash causes you to collapse into hundreds of still-living pieces. If sewn back together, caster can continue living as normal—however, a craftsmanship test and a medicine test are required; 5 SL on both to reassemble caster accurately and subtly. For each number below 5 on the craftsmanship test, your patchwork nature is increasingly obvious to the casual observer. For each number below 5 on the craftsmanship test, caster loses 1 maximum wound due to chronic effects. |
| 16     | **Ironborn**: The caster becomes rather magnetic. In addition to other troubles, arrows and bolts will always hit you if fired into a melee you participate in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 17     | **Parenthood**: The nearest Small-, Medium-, or Large-sized, non-sapient, pregnant vertebrate will produce offspring that are half-human, obviously resembling you, and have equal intelligence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18     | **Gifts**: You gain a pool of 1d6+2 bonus dice. You may add them to any test taken by you or an ally. However, each time a die is used, roll on the minor miscast table with a number of dice equal to the SL of the test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19     | **Continuum**: The spell echoes backwards in time; the timeline alters as if the caster had cast the spell exactly d6 days ago, in whatever location the caster was at that time. The caster and the people in their immediate vicinity are the only ones who remember the unaltered timeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20     | **Dreamt**: The most powerful being within 100 miles will begin seeing you in their dreams every night. You are not portrayed in a flattering manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21     | **Accident**: The spell works perfectly, but on the worst possible target in the immediate area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
