# Panic
Whenever you elect to push a test, or in the case of some abilities, you will gain stress. Stress can be helpful, each stress grants you an extra die on tests. Downside is when you roll a one on a stress die (even when not pushing) you must make a Panic Save.

## Making a Panic Save
Roll a Panic Save as per the character sheet, looking to get SL equal to the number of ones rolled on the stress dice.

If you succeed, reduce stress to 0 and continue the action. If you fail, roll on the following table to determine the effect:

| 2d6+stress | Panic Effect                                                                                                                                                  |

## Reducing Stress
In the heat of combat, a character can make a Intelligence Test to think it through and reduce their stress. Alternatively an ally may attempt a charisma test for the same effect. On a success, reduce stress to zero.

Once calmness has returned, return all stress to zero. If the party is in a stressful situation, the GM may raise the minimum stress.
