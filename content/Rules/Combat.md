# Turn Order
Combat is broken down into rounds, each consisting of a collection of turns, one per participant. At the beginning of each round, a player rolls a d6 for the party. On a 4+ the players have won the initiative.

Turns are taken in one at a time, alternating between players/allies and enemies. If players won the initiative this round, they go first. A character is chosen, any they take a turn. After which an enemy takes a turn. This goes back and forth until everything has taken a turn, then a new round begins with the . 
## Surprise
In instances when surprise occurs, the surprising party takes all turns before the surprised side acts. Then resume normal round/turn order afterwards.

Spotting a surprise involves the character with the best vantage making an opposed test against the most exposed enemy.
# Actions
On their turn, a character can move and take an action. That action can be to move again.
## Movement & Range
Space in Verdigris is abstracted to zones. A character can use their movement to get between zones and enter or exit a melee. 

For the purpose of ranged combat, battles consist within the range of weapons. Penalties can be awarded for attempting long shots, shooting into cover, etc..
## Attacking & Defending
To attack, a player makes a test (strength for melee & bows, agility for crossbows and blackpowder) opposed by the defender's reflex save. If the attacker gets more SL than the defender the attack connects. 

The defender must then make a withstand save, adding gear dice for their armor. Each success reduces the damage of the attack by one. 
### Melees
Melees occur when two or more enemies are within arm’s-reach of each other. This permits either on their turn to attempt to attack each other and prevent either from escaping. Melees are not limited in their number of participants.

If a side has a numeric advantage, all attacks from that side get bonus dice equal to their advantage.

Leaving a melee requires an agility test, which can be opposed by one enemy's attack. Whether it connects or not, you escape the melee. 
### Ranged Combat
Ranged combat uses the relevant skill opposed by the defender’s reflex save.

If the defender is in a melee, the shot suffers from -1 penalty for each participant over 4. If the shot misses with 0 SL, then the shooter strikes an unintended target. Roll randomly to determine.

If the defender has a shield while defending from a ranged attack (except for blackpowder weapons) they get a +1 bonus in their reflex save
### Mounted Combat
Mounts act on the same turn as their rider. Unless trained otherwise, a horse’s natural reaction to danger is to run. When trying to convince a horse to take an action outside its training or tendencies, make a personality test. 
+ Once in a melee, a horse will attack perceived threats using its Quality + Bonus similar to  an attack as made by a player. This test cannot be pushed.
+ The rider gets a +1 to all melee tests made when on horseback as long as their weapon does not have the Short quality.
+ Ranged weapons cannot be shot or reloaded on horseback without the requisite talents.
+ When attacking a mounted enemy, you can opt to strike the mount or the rider, the rider uses reflex saves as usual.
+ Mounts do not count towards numeric advantages for the purposes of melees
### Free Attacks
Free attacks occur when a participant leaves a melee but also under different circumstances. Another example would be when someone is moving through a hostile occupied zone. Such as when leaving the building and attempting to flee for the trees when someone is waiting outside for anyone to run by.
# Damage
Damage lowers the victim's hit points. When enemies are reduced to zero hit points they are incapacitated. The GM will roll to determine if they are actually dead.

When players are reduced to zero hit points, instead reduce your wounds by one, return your hit points to full, and roll on the Critical Injuries table.

When a player is reduced to zero hit points and zero wounds, they are on Death's Door.
## Death’s Door
When a character reaches zero wounds and hit points, they are on Death’s Door. Once a minute or on their turn in combat, make a withstand save. On a fail, the character is dead. 
## Weapon Damage
A [[Weapons & Armor#Weapons|weapon’s table entry]] will have a damage and bonus listed. When a target is struck, reduce the target’s wounds equal to the damage value + 1 for each SL. 

If the defender is wearing armor, they roll a pool of dice equal to the armor’s value and reduce the damage by that much.
