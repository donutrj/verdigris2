Traveling is broken down into quarter days. The group can spend those quarters however they'd like, traveling, foraging, sleeping, etc.
# The Standard Day
While the group can do whatever they want throughout the day, there is a general assumption that half the day will be spent traveling, one quarter will be spent resting, and the last quarter will be a variety of activities.

Maps and travel times assume this is how all days will be spent.
# Activities
The following is a non-exhaustive list of various activities characters can get up to throughout the day. Each will be gone into further below.

| Activity    | Effect                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brewing     | Used to make potions.                                                                             |
| First Aid   | Actively caring for someone to speed their recovery or tend to critical wounds.                   |
| Foraging    | Foraging is used when searching for food or looking for alchemical ingredients.                   |
| Making Camp | Prepares food for the party and ensures the camp is somewhere safe.                               |
| Marching    | Spending the day on the move. Speed can be varied for different affects.                          |
| Resting     | Gain 1d6 recovery dice. See [[Recovery]] for more.                                                |
| Scouting    | One or a group may venture ahead to see what's in the surrounding area.                           |
## Brewing
Spend a quarter day leveraging collected ingredients to brew potions. Learn more about brewing [[Alchemy|here]]. 
## First Aid
By spending a quarter day tending to someone recovering from their wounds, they roll 2d6 and take the better in their recovery.
## Foraging
Spending the time looking for animals, roots, alchemical ingredients, etc. The following table assumes the character is looking for food, representing bonuses to the intelligence test - with each success granting a day's ration.

If spending the day fishing at a viable water, gain +1 to the test. Foraging at night imparts -2 to the test.

The [[Talents Master List#Hunter's Eye|Hunter's Eye]] and [[Talents Master List#Fisherman|Fisherman]] talents supplant this system. 

| Foraging Bonus | Barren | Sparse | Thriving | Verdent |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Storming       | -3     | -2     | -1       | 0       |
| Rain / Ice     | -2     | -1     | +1       | +2      |
| Clear          | -1     | 0      | +2       | +3      |
## Making Camp
There isn't a test required to make camp, bar some environmental challenges or special considerations. A character that makes camp cooks food for the group and ensures everyone has a place to sleep.
## Marching
Marching is how the group will spend much of their travels. A comfortable pace on decent ground does not require any kind of test. Pace, animas, stealth, duration, and difficult terrain / weather will all add some challenge to traveling. 
## Resting
This is the typical nighttime action, where the party sleeps off the day's struggle. This allows the players to roll their 1d6 as per [[Combat#Recovery|recovery]]. It is typical that the party will want to keep watch, and should they, (there are usually two shifts in a night) they would roll 1d3 instead. 

A character cannot be the recipient of first aid and be the lookout simultaneously.
